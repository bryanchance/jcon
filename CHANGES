Changed package name "rts" to "jcon", necessitating
a corresponding change in subdirectory name (ugh).

self-contained.

Icon v9.3.2 is adding the ability to read a directory by
opening it as a file.  I've added corresponding code to Jcon.

You can now say
    jcont ... file.class ...

    p := loadfunc(,name)
to load it.
