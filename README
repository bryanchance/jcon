QUICK INSTALLATION SUMMARY

(If this isn't sufficient, please visit the web site above)

Jcon requires:
    A Unix system with the Korn Shell (/bin/ksh)
    A recent version of Icon  (http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v93u.html)
    Version 1.1 of Java  (http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/)

The icont, javac, java, and jar programs must be in the search path.
Go to the top level of the Jcon distribution and type "make".
There are no configuration options.

When the build completes, the "bin" directory contains everything
needed to run Jcon.  It can be used in place or copied elsewhere.
The rest of the Jcon distribution can be deleted if no longer wanted,
although you may wish to save the html (documentation) directory.
