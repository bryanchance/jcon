This is an initial, limited release of Jcon.
Please do not redistribute it further.

This is a work in progress and still quite volatile.
Features and implementation details are subject to change.



REQUIREMENTS

1.  UNIX WITH /BIN/KSH

Jcon runs on UNIX.  The translator and runtime system are mostly
OS-independent, but a Korn Shell script is the current means of
tying things together.

2.  INSTALLED SOFTWARE

Jcon requires Icon v9, Java v1.1, Zip v2, UnZip v5.

These are all generally available as prebuilt binaries.
Installation of Java may require system privileges and
concurrent installation of some OS patches.

For software see:

    Icon		http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/v93u.html
    Java		http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/
    Zip and UnZip	http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/

3. SEARCH PATH

Executables of icont, javac, java, zip, and unzip must be in the
search path to build or run Jcon or to execute generated binaries.

Binaries of Zip and UnZip can simply be placed in Jcon's "bin"
directory, if that is most convenient, provided that it is added
to the search path.  (That is not practical for Icon or Java,
which are large and complex packages.)



BUILDING JCON

Ensure that your search path is correct, as described above.
Make the top level of the Jcon distribution be your current
directory, and type "make".  There are no configuration options.

When the build completes, the "bin" directory contains everything
needed to run Jcon.  It can be used in place or copied elsewhere.
The rest of the Jcon distribution can be deleted if no longer wanted.



TESTING JCON

The Jcon test suite includes new tests written for Jcon, old tests
from the Icon v9.3 distribution, and a few Icon applications.  The
tests are run by typing "make test".  A successful run produces the
names of the tests, one at a time, as they run.  (On SGI systems,
there may also be a few messages from the Java system about "JIT
translation failed".)

Jcon has been tested by us on:
    SGI Indigo2 / Irix 6.2 / SGI Java 1.1.2
    Sun Sparc2 / Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1) / Sun Java 1.1.2
    DEC Alpha 4/233 / Digital Unix 4.0B / Digital Java 1.1.1beta
We would be interested to learn of either successes or failures
on other platforms.



DOCUMENTATION

The file doc/Article contains an overview of Jcon written for the
Icon Newsletter.

The build process creates a "jcon.txt" file in the bin directory
containing usage information and a very brief summary of the current
implementation state.

A description of the code generator techniques appears in:
    Todd Proebsting, "Simple Translation of Goal-Directed Evaluation",
    Proceedings of the ACM SIGPLAN 1997 Conference on Programming
    Language Design and Implementation (PLDI).  Las Vegas, 1997.

There is no other documentation at this time.
