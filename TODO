TO DO -- JCON
<<ARIZONA-ONLY>>

Line-buffer &output.

Give jcont a way to print its version number.

Better List implementation, a la v9.

Create Main-Class manifest for "java -jar" w/ option to include copy of RTS.

Implement textures and patterns.

Switch to Arrays.sort().  It's stable, and probably faster.
