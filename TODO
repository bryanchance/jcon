TO DO -- JCON
<<ARIZONA-ONLY>>

Check graphics and keycodes under Java 2 etc.

Give jcont a way to print its version number

Better List implementation, a la v9
Create Main-Class manifest for "java -jar" w/ option to include copy of RTS

When Java 2 is universal:
    Implement wide lines.
    Implement textures and patterns.
    Switch to Arrays.sort().  It's stable, and probably faster.
