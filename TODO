TO DO -- JCON

Line-buffer &output.

Give jcont a way to print its version number.

Create Main-Class manifest for "java -jar" w/ option to include copy of RTS.

Redo graphics for modern Java.

Implement textures and patterns.

Make &progname assignable.

Switch to Arrays.sort().  It's stable, and probably faster.

Better List implementation, a la v9.

Review documentation and bring up to date.
