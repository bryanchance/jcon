jcon/bmark -- Jcon Benchmarks

This directory contains the five standard Icon benchmark programs from the
tests/bench directory of version 9.3 of Icon:
	concord, deal, ipxref, queens, rsg
The programs are unchanged, but the Makefile and scripts have been replaced.

These programs are supplemented by two additional long-running applications:
	tgrlink, benchmark

The standard benchmarks use &time to report CPU usage, but &time can only
report wall-clock time for jcont.  Consequently, we use times as reported
by the Korn shell.  These times include run-time initialization, which puts
Jcon at a disadvantage compared to the previous method.  To partially
compensate, some program arguments and data files have been changed to yield
longer execution times.

To run the benchmarks, just type "make".
To redisplay the most recent timings, type "make report".
To rerun the timings, type "make rerun".
To clean up, type "make clean".
