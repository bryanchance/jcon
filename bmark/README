jcon/bmark -- Standard Icon benchmarks

These are the standard Icon benchmark programs from the tests/bench
directory of version 9.3 of Icon.  The programs are unchanged, but
the Makefile and scripts have been replaced.

The standard benchmarks use &time to report CPU usage, but &time
can only report wall-clock time for jcont.  Consequently, we use
times as reported by the shell.  These times include initialization,
which puts jcont at a disadvantage compared to the previous method.
To partially compensate, some program arguments and data files have
been changed to yield longer execution times.

To run the benchmarks, just type "make".
To redisplay the most recent timings, type "make report".
To rerun the timings, type "make rerun".
To clean up, type "make clean".
