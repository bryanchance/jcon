These are all considered correct in Jcon and wrong
(or at least less pleasing) in v9:

-- *&main is 0, not 1
-- seek(-n) fails if n > filesize
-- to-by handles overflow in "n to MAXINT" case
-- 1 / 0 gives error 201 instead of error 204
-- set() ++ 0 reports the 0 as the offending value
-- traceback is deliberately limited to the innermost 100 nested calls
-- "R . field" errors (e.g. 107, 207) give actual field name attempted
-- collect(1,1000000000) fails....
