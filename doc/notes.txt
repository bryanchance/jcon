what's implemented:
-- all datatypes (but only 64-bit integers; no large integers)
-- most keywords;  missing &time
-- most functions; missing chdir(), loadfunc(), getch()/getche()/kbhit()
-- no graphics
-- "icont -E" is used for preprocessing

general caveats:
-- little optimization has been done
-- some Java datatypes are suboptimal e.g. for push(L)/pop(L)
-- crude tracing can be enabled by setting &trace
-- the TRACE environment variable is *not* honored

building programs:
-- jcont is a complex script that only runs on Unix
-- "jcont foo.zip" doesn't search IPATH (only link'd files are searched for)
-- link directives must give a simple name (not a path)
-- compiled .zip files cannot be renamed: name must match original .icn name
   (however, executables can be renamed)

strings and csets:
-- Jcon uses 8-bit characters, not Unicode
-- image(c) doesn't recognize &digits, &lcase, etc.

numerics:
-- overflow and underflow are not detected
-- conversion of radix integers to strings does not work
-- conversion of reals to strings may not match v9 exactly
-- conversion of strings to reals and integers probably follows different rules

files:
-- no "translated mode" code for Mac or Windows
-- no buffering, except possibly on &input/&output/&errout
-- no pipes
-- random I/O (seek(), where()) fails for &input/&output/&errout

structures:
-- random selection from sets and tables differs from v9
-- insertion/deletion during set/table generation can confuse the generator

error reporting:
-- arg lists in traceback show actual instead of expected number of arguments
   (e.g.: a call to insert() traces as insert() not insert(&null,&null,&null))
-- in traceback images, list contents and record fields are omitted

miscellaneous:
-- commands run by system(s) do not inherit stdin/stdout/error 
-- display() ignores its arguments (and displays everything)
-- display() prints globals in an unsorted order
-- function() generates names in an unsorted order
-- allocation-related keywords (&allocated, &collections, &storage, &regions)
   produce only 0's

arguably correct differences:
-- tables sort after sets, and co-expressions after files, as per the Icon book
-- seek(-n) fails if n > filesize
-- to-by handles overflow in "n to MAXINT" case
-- 1 / 0 gives error 201 instead of error 204
-- traceback is deliberately limited to the innermost 100 nested calls
-- "R . field" errors (e.g. 107, 207) give actual field name attempted
-- collect(1,1000000000) fails....

extensions:
-- proc(i) produces a procedure that returns its ith argument
-- a[i:j,k:m] is accepted as shorthand for a[i:j][k:m]

compatible, although the book is unclear or wrong:
-- procedures, functions, and record constructors all sort together, by name
-- records sort first by type and then by serial number
-- sortf() signals error 125, not 126, for wrong type
-- args() uses same rules for builtin and declared varargs procedures
-- flush(f) returns f, not null

known bugs:
-- e[e+:e] and e[e-:e] function identically to v9, which is wrong in some cases
-- local variables are not dereferenced prior to being returned
-- "invocable" procedures are computed incorrectly.  "invocable all" works.
   Basically, too many user procedures are considered invocable.
