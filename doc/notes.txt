running the scripts:
-- add /cs/jive/<platform>/bin to your Unix search path
-- <platform> is one of {linux,digital,solaris}

what's implemented:
-- all datatypes except "file" (but there are no large integers)
-- all operators except unary "="
-- some keywords (see list)
-- some built-in functions (see list)
-- no "link" declaration support
-- no "invocable" declaration support
-- no graphics
-- no preprocessor

general caveats:
-- scripts etc. are still somewhat primitive
-- separate compilation is not available
-- no optimization has been done
-- crude tracing can be enabled by setting &trace

strings and csets:
-- image() doesn't escape special characters
-- image(c) doesn't recognize &digits, &lcase, etc.
-- csets may be up to 2^16 characters; big ones run slowly; &cset is missing
-- char() and ord() work in the range 0 - 65535

numerics:
-- overflow or underflow is not detected
-- conversion of reals (& possibly integers) to strings does not match v9
-- conversion of strings to reals and integers probably follows different rules

error reporting:
-- arg lists in traceback show actual instead of expected number of arguments
   (e.g.: a call to insert() traces as insert() not insert(&null,&null,&null))
-- long strings are not elided, list contents are omitted, etc.
-- error recovery is not implemented yet

miscellaneous:
-- random selection uses Java's RNG, presumably generating different sequences
-- random sequences are different on every run
-- read() and write() don't accept file arguments
-- display() ignores its arguments (and displays everything)
-- display() prints globals in an unsorted order
-- proc(x,0) does not find builtins that have been over-ridden.
-- jcon always allocates a list even if main() declares no arguments
-- compiler silently ignores illegal multiply-defined names
   (e.g., record foo(a,a,a), procedure foo(a,a,a), etc.)
-- "linker" silently ignores multiply-defined names
   (e.g., global foo, procedure foo())

arguably correct differences:
-- tables sort after sets, as per the Icon book but contrary to v9
-- to-by handles overflow in "n to MAXINT" case
-- 1 / 0 gives error 201 instead of error 204
-- traceback is deliberately limited to the innermost 100 nested calls
-- "R . field" errors (e.g. 107, 207) give actual field name attempted

extensions:
-- proc(i) produces a procedure that returns its ith argument

compatible, although the book is unclear or wrong:
-- procedures, functions, and record constructors all sort together, by name
-- records sort first by type and then by serial number
-- args() uses same rules for builtin and declared varargs procedures

known bugs:
-- e[e+:e] and e[e-:e] function identically to v9, which is wrong
-- on the Dec Alpha, a rightward ishift() doesn't sign extend  [Java bug]
