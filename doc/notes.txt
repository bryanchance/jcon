what's implemented:
-- all datatypes (but only 64-bit integers; no large integers)
-- all keywords, although resource keywords produce zeroes
-- preprocessing
-- most functions; missing chdir(), loadfunc(), getch()/getche()/kbhit()
-- only part of the graphics repertoire (see below)

compilation and linking:
-- jcont is a complex script that only runs on Unix
-- "jcont foo.zip" doesn't search IPATH (only link'd files are searched for)
-- link directives must give a simple name (not a path)
-- compiled .zip files cannot be renamed: name must match original .icn name
   (however, executables can be renamed)

execution:
-- if Java runs out of memory, setenv JXOPTS='-mx50m' (e.g.) to increase max
-- out-of-memory errors say "block region"; there is no separate string region
-- $PATH must include env and uname commands to use getenv() and &hostname
-- tracing (set by $TRACE or &trace) includes operators and built-in functions

known bugs:
-- local variables are not dereferenced prior to being returned
-- more procedures may be "invocable" than in v9

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

strings and csets:
-- Jcon uses 8-bit characters, not Unicode

numerics:
-- arithmetic overflow and underflow are not detected
-- conversion of reals to strings does not match results from v9
-- conversion of strings to reals and integers follows slightly different rules

structures:
-- random selection from sets and tables differs from v9

files:
-- a tty input request does not automatically flush tty output first
-- &errout is always unbuffered
-- random I/O (seek(), where()) fails for &input/&output/&errout
-- processes run by system(s) or open(s,"p") do not inherit stdin/stdout/error 
   -- stdin is empty, except with open(s,"wp") where it comes from the program
   -- stdout and stderr are copied from the process when it terminates

error reporting:
-- arg lists in traceback show actual instead of expected number of arguments
   (e.g.: a call to insert() traces as insert() not insert(&null,&null,&null))
-- record fields are not shown in traceback images

miscellaneous:
-- no OS symbols (e.g. _UNIX) are predefined; _JAVA is predefined
-- function() generates names in an unsorted order
-- &time produces elapsed wall-clock time, not CPU time, due to Java limitations
-- &allocated, &collections, &storage, and &regions produce only zero values

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

extensions:
-- proc(i) produces a procedure that returns its ith argument
-- a[i:j,k:m] is accepted as shorthand for a[i:j][k:m]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

graphics overview:
-- only some of the graphics features are present
-- omissions include clipping, dx/dy translation, images, wide lines
-- see rts/wBuiltins.java for the list of implemented functions
-- see rts/wAttrib.java for the list of implemented attributes

graphics bugs:
-- window repair is only done when paused for event input
-- &interval is always zero
-- graphics output is flushed before any read() -- even untranslated from disk

graphics (general):
-- no sharing of graphics contexts among windows by Couple() or Clone()

events:
-- Java distinguishes "alt" and "meta" keys; Jcon maps both to the &meta flag
-- &meta is never set with mouse events (Java uses it to encode "which button")
-- X returns "\r" for the Enter key but Java (and therefore Jcon) returns "\n"
-- "outboard" keys differ from X, are similar to Windows; see bin/keysyms.icn
-- resize events are not reported yet

colors:
-- variants (dark, weak, ..) of unsaturated colors (brown, pink, violet) differ
-- "light black" and "pale black" produce black, not shades of gray
-- there is no inherent limit to the number of colors in use
-- on 8-bit displays, depending on the Java system, colors may be approximated
-- mutable colors are not available
-- gamma correction is not yet implemented; acts as if gamma=1.0

fonts:
-- Java family names are case sensitive
-- Icon generic family names, and all characteristics, are case-insensitive
-- generic names {serif, sans, typewriter} work well; bold/italic variants work
-- generic "mono" appearance varies by platform; bold/italic don't always work
-- Font(s) always succeeds for non-empty s (Java never rejects any name)
-- the special X font name "fixed" is modeled imperfectly by "mono,10"

text:
-- read(), write(), etc. work with windows
-- \r and \t are not handled correctly on output
-- some Java font metrics are bogus, leading to various problems
-- the visible text cursor, when enabled, is a solid, nonblinking underbar

miscellaneous:
-- WDefault() always fails
