jcon/gtest -- graphics tests

This directory contains source code for programs written to test
the graphics features of Icon.  See the comments in the individual 
files for more information (at least in some cases).

In general, these programs must be run manually and then compared
visually with the same programs run by Version 9 of Icon.  Some
differences are to be expected due to differences in fonts or
unimplemented features (especially linewidth, patterns, and mutable
colors).

The programs in the demo directory (../demo) also serve well as
graphics tests.
