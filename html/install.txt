<P> Building Jcon is simple if the requisite software is available.
Automated tests are provided to validate the build.

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<P> Jcon is written in Icon, Java, and Korn Shell.

<H4>Unix with the Korn shell</H4>

<P> Building and running Jcon requires various Unix utilities including
the Korn Shell.
Any system that has <CODE>/bin/ksh</CODE> will probably work.
Most commercial Unix systems supply <CODE>ksh</CODE>,
and the <CODE>ksh</CODE> clone on Linux also works.

<H4>Installed Software</H4>

<P> Jcon requires a recent version of Icon and version 1.1 of Java.
Prebuilt binaries of these are available for many platforms.
Installation of Java may require system privileges,
and proper functioning of some Java systems may require installation
of OS patches.

<P> For software see:

<H4>Search Path</H4>

<P> Executables of <CODE>icont</CODE>, <CODE>javac</CODE>, <CODE>java</CODE>,
and <CODE>jar</CODE> must be in the search path
to build programs with Jcon.
Only <CODE>java</CODE> is needed for execution.

<H3>Building Jcon</H3>

<P> Ensure that your search path is correct, as described above.
Set your current directory to the top level of the Jcon distribution,
and type <CODE>make</CODE>.
There are no configuration options.

<P> When the build completes, the <CODE>bin</CODE> directory contains
everything needed to run Jcon.
It can be used in place or copied elsewhere.
The <CODE>html</CODE> directory, which contains documentation,
can also be retained.
The rest of the Jcon distribution can be deleted if no longer wanted.

<P> After building Jcon using <CODE>icont</CODE>,
it is possible to rebuild Jcon using Jcon.
This optional step is accomplished by typing <CODE>make jj</CODE>;
it enables the use of <CODE>jcont -J</CODE>.  


<H3>Testing Jcon</H3>

<P> The Jcon test suite includes new tests written for Jcon, old tests
from the Icon v9.3 distribution, and a few Icon applications.
The tests are run by typing <CODE>make test</CODE>.
A successful run produces the names of the tests, one at a time, as they run.

<P> Jcon has been tested by us on:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	SGI Indigo2 / Irix 6.2 / SGI Java 3.1 (JDK 1.1.5K)
	<BR> Sun Sparc / Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1) / Sun Java 1.1.6N
	<BR> IBM RS6000 / AIX 4.1.5 / IBM Java 1.1.4-19980430
	<BR> DEC Alpha / Digital Unix 4.0B / Digital Java 1.1.6-2
	<BR> Intel / Linux v2 (Red Hat 5.0) / Blackdown Java 1.1.5v7
</BLOCKQUOTE>
We would be interested to learn of either successes or failures
on other platforms.

<P> In addition to the automated tests, Jcon comes with additional
tests that can be run manually.
The <CODE>demo</CODE> directory contains graphics programs that
are interesting as demonstrations.
The <CODE>gtest</CODE> directory contains other graphics programs
that are less interesting and require manual visual comparison
with the displays produced by Version 9 of Icon.
The <CODE>expt</CODE> directory contains a few additional
nongraphical tests and experiments.

<H3>Directory Structure</H3>

<P> The subdirectories within the Jcon tree are as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
bin      target for all build products; also includes jcont script
tran     source code for the translator
rts      source code for the run-time system
html     files for building documentation pages
test     automated test collection for validating Jcon
gtest    manually run test collection for graphics
demo     demonstration programs utilizing graphics
expt     other tests and experiments to be run manually
bmark    benchmark collection
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
Each directory contains a README file with further information.
