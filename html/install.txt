#%#%#% THIS NEEDS UPDATING

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<H4>Unix with the Korn shell</H4>

<P>
Building and running Jcon requires various Unix utilities including
the Korn Shell.
Unix systems with /bin/ksh qualify, of course.
The ksh clone on Linux also works.

<H4>Installed Software</H4>

<P>
Jcon requires a recent version of Icon and version 1.1 of Java.
Prebuilt binaries of these are available for many platforms.
Installation of Java may require system privileges,
and proper functioning of some Java systems may require installation
of OS patches.

<P>
For software see:

<H4>Search Path</H4>

<P>
Executables of <CODE>icont</CODE>, <CODE>javac</CODE>, <CODE>java</CODE>,
and <CODE>jar</CODE> must be in the search path
to build programs with Jcon.
Only <CODE>java</CODE> is needed for execution.

<H3>Building Jcon</H3>

<P>
Ensure that your search path is correct, as described above.
Make the top level of the Jcon distribution be your current directory,
and type <CODE>make</CODE>.
There are no configuration options.

<P>
When the build completes, the <CODE>bin</CODE> directory contains everything
needed to run Jcon.  It can be used in place or copied elsewhere.
The rest of the Jcon distribution can be deleted if no longer wanted.

<P>
After building Jcon using icont, it is possible to rebuild Jcon using Jcon.
This optional step is accomplished by typing <CODE>make jj</CODE>;
it enables the use of <CODE>jcont -J</CODE>.  



<H3>Testing Jcon</H3>

<P>
The Jcon test suite includes new tests written for Jcon, old tests
from the Icon v9.3 distribution, and a few Icon applications.
The tests are run by typing <CODE>make test</CODE>.
A successful run produces the names of the tests, one at a time, as they run.

<P>
Jcon has been tested by us on:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
SGI Indigo2 / Irix 6.2 / SGI Java 3.1 (JDK 1.1.5)
Sun Sparc / Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1) / Sun Java 1.1.6
DEC Alpha 4/233 / Digital Unix 4.0B / Digital Java 1.1.3
Intel / Linux v2 (Red Hat 5.0) / Blackdown Java 1.1.5v7
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
We would be interested to learn of either successes or failures
on other platforms.


<H3>Directory Structure</H3>

<P>
The subdirectories within the Jcon tree are as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>
bin      target for all build products; also includes jcont script
tran     source code for the translator
rts      source code for the runtime system
doc      such documentation as exists; builds bin/notes.txt
test     automated test collection for validating Jcon
expt     other tests, demos, and experiments to be run manually
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
