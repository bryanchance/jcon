<P> Building Jcon is simple if the requisite software is available.
Automated tests are provided to validate the build.

<H3>Requirements</H3>

<P> Jcon is written in Icon, Java, and Unix shell scripts.

<H4>Unix with a POSIX shell</H4>

<P> Building and running Jcon requires various Unix utilities including
a POSIX shell in /bin/sh.
Most modern Unix systems (including Mac and Linux) will work.
It may be necessary to install &ldquo;developer&rdquo; packages.

<H4>Installed Software</H4>

<P> Jcon requires recent versions of
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/current/">Icon</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java</A>.
Prebuilt binaries of these are available for many platforms.

<H4>Search Path</H4>

<P> Executables of <CODE>icont</CODE>, <CODE>javac</CODE>, <CODE>java</CODE>,
and <CODE>jar</CODE> must be in the search path
to build the Jcon system.
Only <CODE>java</CODE> is needed to run <CODE>jcont</CODE> or the
executables it produces.

<H3>Building Jcon</H3>

<P> Ensure that your search path is correct, as described above.
Set your current directory to the top level of the Jcon distribution,
and type <CODE>make</CODE>.
There are no configuration options.

<P> When the build completes, the <CODE>bin</CODE> directory contains
everything needed to run Jcon.
It can be used in place or copied elsewhere.
The <CODE>html</CODE> directory, which contains documentation,
is also worth keeping.
The rest of the Jcon distribution can be deleted if no longer wanted.

<P> After building Jcon using <CODE>icont</CODE>,
it is possible use Jcon to rebuild itself.
This optional step is accomplished by typing <CODE>make jj</CODE>;
it enables the use of <CODE>jcont -J</CODE>.  


<H3>Testing Jcon</H3>

<P> The Jcon test suite includes new tests written for Jcon, old tests
from the Icon v9.3 distribution, and a few Icon applications.
The tests are run by typing <CODE>make test</CODE>.
A successful run produces the names of the tests, one at a time, as they run.

<P> In addition to the automated tests, Jcon comes with additional
tests that can be run manually.
The <CODE>demo</CODE> directory contains graphics programs that
are interesting as demonstrations.
The <CODE>gtest</CODE> directory contains other graphics programs
that are less interesting and require visual comparison
with the displays produced by Version 9 of Icon.
The <CODE>expt</CODE> directory contains a few additional
nongraphical tests and experiments.

<H3>Directory Structure</H3>

<P> The subdirectories within the Jcon tree are as follows:
