<P> Jcon is a new Java-based implementation of the Icon programming language.
The Jcon translator, written in Icon, generates Java class files that
execute in conjunction with a run-time system written in Java.

<P> Jcon is an essentially complete implementation of classic Icon,
omitting only a few things such as <CODE>chdir()</CODE>
that cannot be done in Java.
Co-expressions, large integers, and pipes are provided,
and a preprocessor is included.  String invocation is supported.
Tracing, error recovery, and debugging functions are all included,
although for performance reasons they are disabled by default.
There are a few minor deficiencies due to Java limitations.

<P> The graphics implementation is nearly complete, but wide lines
and textured drawing are omitted.
These two features will be easier to implement after version 1.2 of Java
becomes universally available.
A few other features, notably mutable colors, are also unavailable.

<P> The <CODE>jcont</CODE> script functions similarly to <CODE>icont</CODE>.
The end result of compilation is an executable file, which is produced
by embedding a Zip archive of Java classes (a "Jar file")
inside a shell script.
Separate compilation is also supported, with <CODE>.zip</CODE> files
substituting for <CODE>.u1/.u2</CODE> file pairs.

<H3>Implementation</H3>

<P> The Jcon translator is a 10,000-line Icon program that produces Java
class files.
(It can also produce <CODE>.u1/.u2</CODE> files,
but it provides no way to link them.)
This is about the same size as the translator in Version 9 of Icon,
which is written in C.

<P> The Jcon runtime system comprises 18,000 lines of Java code.
The corresponding portion of Version 9, counting only the Unix code,
is over 50,000 lines of C code.

<P> The <CODE>jcont</CODE> script that directs compilation and linking
is a 400-line Korn shell script.
While this works well for Unix, it is the single largest impediment
to a non-Unix port.
We believe that a replacement program would be the easiest route
to a Windows or Macintosh port.

<P> Jcon includes an automated test suite containing 8000 lines of
Icon programs.
These are drawn from the standard Icon test suite,
other existing Icon programs, and 3000 lines of new tests.
Jcon also includes additional manually-run graphics tests and
a small collection of graphics demos.

<P> Jcon was designed and implemented by the authors
with contributions from Denise Todd and Bob Alexander.
