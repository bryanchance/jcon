<P> Jcon is a new Java-based implementation of the Icon programming language.
The Jcon translator, written in Icon, generates Java class files that
execute in conjunction with a run-time system written in Java.

<P> Jcon is an essentially complete implementation of classic Icon,
omitting only a few things such as <CODE>chdir()</CODE>
that cannot be done in Java.
Co-expressions, large integers, and pipes are provided,
and a preprocessor is included.  String invocation is supported.
Tracing, error recovery, and debugging functions are all included,
although for performance reasons they are disabled by default.
There are a few minor deficiencies due to Java limitations.

<P> The graphics implementation is nearly complete, but wide lines
and textured drawing are omitted.
These two features will be easier to implement after version 1.2 of Java
becomes universally available.
A few other features, notably mutable colors, are also unavailable.

<P> The <CODE>jcont</CODE> script functions similarly to <CODE>icont</CODE>.
The end result of compilation is an executable file, which is produced
by embedding a Zip archive of Java classes (a "Jar file")
inside a shell script.
Separate compilation is also supported, with <CODE>.zip</CODE> files
substituting for <CODE>.u1/.u2</CODE> file pairs.

<H3>Implementation</H3>

<P> The Jcon translator is a 9500-line Icon program that produces Java
class files.
(It can also produce <CODE>.u1/.u2</CODE> files,
but it provides no way to link them.)
The Icon translator, written in C, is comparable in size.

<P> The Jcon runtime system is written in 17000 lines of Java code.
$$$$$$$$$ CONTRAST v9, need to re-measure with graphics included $$$$$$$$$$$$

<P> The <CODE>jcont</CODE> script that directs compilation and linking
is a 400-line Korn shell script.
While this has worked well for Unix, it is the single largest impediment
to a non-Unix port.

<P> Jcon includes an automated test suite containing 8000 lines of
Icon programs.
These are drawn from the standard Icon test suite,
other existing Icon programs, and 2300 (????--CHECK--????) lines of new tests.

<PRE>
what's implemented:
-- all datatypes including large integers
-- all keywords, although resource keywords produce zeroes
-- preprocessing
-- graphics
-- most functions; missing chdir(), getch()/getche()/kbhit()
