<H3>Performance</H3>

<P> Programs built by Jcon typically run somewhat slower than when
built and run by Version 9 of Icon.
We use the ratio of execution times as our basic benchmark measurement.
The result depends on many things, but a factor of three is typical
with a good Java system.

<P> We have measured execution times for the standard Icon benchmarks
and for three long-running additional applications. 
The standard benchmark programs were taken from Icon v9.3.1 and run unmodified,
but some data files and command options were changed to make them run longer.
The <CODE>tgrlink</CODE> application optimizes data files for
<A HREF="/icon/oddsends/tiger/tiger.htm">drawing maps</A>.
The <CODE>geddump</CODE> application prints the contents of a
genealogy database.
The <CODE>jtran</CODE> application is the translator portion of Jcon,
compiling one of its own constituent files.

<P> We did most of our performance tuning on a 
Silicon Graphics Indigo2 running SGI Java 3.1 (JDK 1.1.5).
This is a good Java implementation running on a fast machine.
It uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to convert JVM code to machine code
as needed.
There is a minimum one-second startup cost for every execution,
which we attribute to initialization and JIT compilation;
this cost is included in the measurements below but is
not the dominating factor.

<P> Here are execution time ratios measured on several platforms:
