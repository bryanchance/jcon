<P> Programs built by Jcon typically run somewhat slower than when
built and run by Version 9 of Icon.
We use the ratio of execution times as our basic benchmark measurement.
The result depends on many things, but a factor of three is typical
with a good Java system.

<P> We have measured execution times for the standard Icon benchmarks
and for three long-running additional applications. 
The standard benchmark programs were taken from Icon v9.3.1 and run unmodified,
but some data files and command options were changed to make them run longer.
The benchmark programs are as follows:

<P> We did most of our performance tuning on a 
Silicon Graphics Indigo2 running SGI Java 3.1 (JDK 1.1.5).
This is a good Java implementation running on a fast machine.
It uses just-in-time (JIT) compilation to convert JVM code to machine code
as needed.
There is a minimum one-second startup cost for every execution,
which we attribute to initialization and JIT compilation;
this cost is included in the measurements below but is
not the dominating factor.

<P> Here are execution time ratios measured on several platforms:
