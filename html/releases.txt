<P> Version 1.0 of Jcon implemented the classic core of the
Icon programming language and some basic graphics facilities.
Version 2.0 adds large integers, dynamic loading, and graphics.

<P> Version 2.0 also incorporates radical changes in the implementation
that provide a typical performance improvement of 40%.

<H3>Notable changes from Version 1</H3>
<UL>
    <LI>Compilation with <CODE>-f d</CODE> is now needed for tracing,
	detailed traceback, or error conversion (&amp;error)
    <LI><CODE>variable()</CODE>, <CODE>display()</CODE>,
	and <CODE>&amp;dump</CODE> can access only global variables
    <LI>Command options for <CODE>jcont</CODE> are closer to those
	of <CODE>icont</CODE>
    <LI>Section wraparound (e.g. <CODE>"abcd"[-2+:3]</CODE>)
	now yields failure, fixing a venerable bug
</UL>

<H3>Known problems (nongraphical)</H3>
<UL>
    <LI><CODE>&amp;clock</CODE> and <CODE>&amp;dateline</CODE>
	may be off by an hour due to Java library bugs
</UL>

<H3>Known graphics problems</H3>

<UL>
    <LI>Some Java implementations produce an extra resize event when
	a window is first opened
    <LI>Window repair may be delayed until the program pauses
	to await an event
    <LI>DEC Java 1.1.6 sometimes writes different fonts to the window
	and its backup image, leading to bizarre effects from
	<CODE>CopyArea()</CODE> and window repair
    <LI><CODE>WOpen("image=file.gif")</CODE> does not initialize the
   	window contents if presented with a multi-part (animated) GIF image
    <LI><CODE>drawop=reverse</CODE> draws the wrong color under rare
	conditions that are not understood
</UL>
