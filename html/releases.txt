<PRE>
additions in v2:
-- programs run about 40% faster
-- large integers are implemented
-- loadfunc() is implemented
-- most of the graphics repertoire is implemented
-- section wraparound (e.g. "abcd"[-2+:3]) yields failure  (this is a bugfix)
-- function() generates names in sorted order
-- record fields are shown in traceback images

losses in v2:
-- compilation with "-fn" is needed for tracing, detailed traceback, or &amp;error
-- variable(), display(), and &amp;dump can access only global variables

graphics infelicities:
-- window repair may be delayed until the program pauses for input
-- "drawop=reverse" may draw wrong color under rare conditions not understood
-- DEC Java 1.1.6 exhibits problems with fonts and font metrics
