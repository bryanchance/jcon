<P> The Git version of Jcon includes several changes since
the last public release of version 2.1 in 1999.

<UL>
<LI> The source code is now compatible with Java 8 (Java v1.8).
<LI> For consistency with v9, <CODE>reads()</CODE>
	no longer translates line terminators.
<LI> <CODE>&amp;time</CODE> now properly reports CPU time
     instead of wall-clock time.
<LI> The <CODE>linewidth</CODE> graphics attribute is now implemented.
<LI> Some minor bugs have been fixed.
</UL>

<H3>Tested Platforms</H3>

<P> Jcon has been successfully tested on:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mac OS 10.10.4 (Yosemite) / Oracle Java 1.8.0_05
	<BR>Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS / Java 1.7.0_05
	<BR>Ubuntu 12.04.4 LTS / Java 1.6.0_26
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> We would be interested to learn of either successes or failures
on other platforms.

<H3> Problems seen recently </H3>

<UL>
    <LI> Graphics windows are often incorrect when first opened.
    	This seems to be a timing problem (race condition) of some sort.
    <LI> If a source file contains two procedures whose names differ
	only in lettercase, one will be lost if compiled on a case-insensitive
	filesystem such as the usual Macintosh filesystem.
	<!-- in IPL: gprocs/viface.icn vsetfont, vecho -->
</UL>

<H3>Older unverified problems (nongraphical)</H3>
<UL>
    <LI>Some JIT compilers fail to execute Jcon programs correctly.
	Disabling the JIT compiler produces correct execution.
	<!-- Sun JDK1.2, Sun HotSpot, IBM AIX Java -->
	<!-- Also IBM Linux java, the ck test (-0.0 vs. 0.0) -->
    <LI>The <CODE>-S</CODE> option of <CODE>jcont</CODE> does not work
    	for programs that link other files.
    <LI><CODE>&amp;clock</CODE> and <CODE>&amp;dateline</CODE>
	may be off by one hour (Java bug #4059431).
    <LI>On Solaris systems, <CODE>&amp;host</CODE>
	may return "localhost" (Java bug #4073539).
    <LI>Extremely large procedures (thousands of lines long)
	can generate code that is too large for Java to handle.
</UL>

<H3>Older graphics problems</H3>

<P> Some problems are universal:
<UL>
    <LI>When an obscured part of a window is exposed,
	it may not be repaired (redrawn) until the program
	pauses to await an event.
    <LI><CODE>WOpen("image=file.gif")</CODE> does not load an image
   	if presented with a multi-part (animated) GIF image.
    <LI>A java exception may occur during program termination.
</UL>
<P> Other problems are seen only on some platforms and are
attributed to Java bugs:
<UL>
    <LI>Fonts can be poor when one vendor's Java system displays
    	on another vendor's X server. <!--esp. Sun Java-->
    <LI>Different fonts may be written to the window and to
	and its backup image, leading to bizarre effects from
	<CODE>CopyArea()</CODE> and window repair. <!--Dec 1.1.6, Sun 1.2-->
    <LI>On one older system, nothing appears in a window
	until it is dragged to a different location. <!--Linux 1.1.7a-->
    <LI>The initial window size may not be as specified:
    	<UL>
	    <LI> It is one pixel too wide, or	<!--DEC-->
	    <LI> It is always the default size, or 
	    <LI> Its height is correct but its width is the default.
	    	<!--Linux 1.1.7a-->
	</UL>
    <LI>Intermittently, <CODE>drawop=reverse</CODE> draws the wrong color.
    <LI>GIF images have a yellowish tint. <!--IBM Java 1.1.6-19990401-->
    <LI>The <CODE>CopyArea()</CODE> section of the <CODE>gpxtest</CODE>
    	program shows a minor glitch. <!--Sun1.2Ref+hotspot-->
</UL>
