<P> Version 2.2 of Jcon includes minor feature additions,
documentation edits, and bug fixes.  
Changes include the following:

<UL>
<LI> The source code is now compatible with Java 6 (Java v1.6).
<LI> The <CODE>linewidth</CODE> graphics attribute is now implemented.
</UL>

<H3>Tested Platforms</H3>

<P> Jcon has been successfully tested on:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mac OS 10.7 (Lion) / Sun Java 1.6.0_26
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> We would be interested to learn of either successes or failures
on other platforms.

<H3>Known problems (nongraphical)</H3>
<SMALL>(not recently verified)</SMALL>
<UL>
    <LI>Some JIT compilers fail to execute Jcon programs correctly.
	Disabling the JIT compiler produces correct execution.
	<!-- Sun JDK1.2, Sun HotSpot, IBM AIX Java -->
	<!-- Also IBM Linux java, the ck test (-0.0 vs. 0.0) -->
    <LI>The <CODE>-S</CODE> option of <CODE>jcont</CODE> does not work
    	for programs that link other files.
    <LI><CODE>&amp;clock</CODE> and <CODE>&amp;dateline</CODE>
	may be off by one hour (Java bug #4059431).
    <LI>On Solaris systems, <CODE>&amp;host</CODE>
	may return "localhost" (Java bug #4073539).
    <LI>Extremely large procedures (thousands of lines long)
	can generate code that is too large for Java to handle.
</UL>

<H3>Known graphics problems</H3>
<SMALL>(not recently verified)</SMALL>

<P> Some problems are universal:
<UL>
    <LI>When an obscured part of a window is exposed,
	it may not be repaired (redrawn) until the program
	pauses to await an event.
    <LI><CODE>WOpen("image=file.gif")</CODE> does not load an image
   	if presented with a multi-part (animated) GIF image.
    <LI>A java exception may occur during program termination.
</UL>
<P> Other problems are seen only on some platforms and are
attributed to Java bugs:
<UL>
    <LI>Fonts can be poor when one vendor's Java system displays
    	on another vendor's X server. <!--esp. Sun Java-->
    <LI>Different fonts may be written to the window and to
	and its backup image, leading to bizarre effects from
	<CODE>CopyArea()</CODE> and window repair. <!--Dec 1.1.6, Sun 1.2-->
    <LI>On one older system, nothing appears in a window
	until it is dragged to a different location. <!--Linux 1.1.7a-->
    <LI>The initial window size may not be as specified:
    	<UL>
	    <LI> It is one pixel too wide, or	<!--DEC-->
	    <LI> It is always the default size, or 
	    <LI> Its height is correct but its width is the default.
	    	<!--Linux 1.1.7a-->
	</UL>
    <LI>Intermittently, <CODE>drawop=reverse</CODE> draws the wrong color.
    <LI>GIF images have a yellowish tint. <!--IBM Java 1.1.6-19990401-->
    <LI>The <CODE>CopyArea()</CODE> section of the <CODE>gpxtest</CODE>
    	program shows a minor glitch. <!--Sun1.2Ref+hotspot-->
</UL>
