<P> Version 2.1 of Jcon includes minor feature additions,
documentation edits, and bug fixes.  
Changes include the following:

<UL>
    <LI> A directory can be read by opening it as a file.
    <LI> JPEG images can be written under Java 2 implementations.
    <LI> Large integers now work with <CODE>to</CODE>-<CODE>by</CODE>,
	 <CODE>seq()</CODE>, and limitation (<CODE>e1 \ e2</CODE>)
    <LI> A zero increment value is diagnosed by <CODE>seq()</CODE>
    <LI> <CODE>&host</CODE> no longer spawns a shell invocation
	of <CODE>uname</CODE> (but see <CITE>Problems</CITE>, below)
    <LI> The run-time package name has been changed from <CODE>rts</CODE>
    	to <CODE>jcon</CODE>.  All programs must be recompiled.
</UL>

<H3>Tested Platforms</H3>

<P> Jcon has been successfully tested on:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	SGI Indigo2 / Irix 6.2 / SGI Java 3.1.1 (JDK 1.1.6N)
	<BR> Sun Sparc / Solaris 2.6 (SunOS 5.6) / Sun Java 1.1.6N
	<BR> IBM RS6000 / AIX 4.1.5 / IBM Java 1.1.4-19980430
	<BR> DEC Alpha / Digital Unix 4.0B / Digital Java 1.1.6-2
	<BR> Intel / Linux v2 (Red Hat 5.0) / Blackdown Java 1.1.5v7
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P> We also tested Jcon using the JDK 1.2beta4 release for Solaris 2.6.
Nongraphical programs worked well, but many problems were seen in
graphics applications.

<P> We would be interested to learn of either successes or failures
on other platforms.

<H3>Known problems (nongraphical)</H3>
<UL>
    <LI>The <CODE>-S</CODE> of <CODE>jcont</CODE> does not work
    	for programs that link other files.
    <LI><CODE>&amp;clock</CODE> and <CODE>&amp;dateline</CODE>
	may be off by one hour (Java bug #4059431)
    <LI>On Solaris systems, <CODE>&amp;host</CODE>
	may return "localhost" (Java bug #4073539)
    <LI>Extremely large procedures (thousands of lines long)
	can generate code that is too large for Java to handle
</UL>

<H3>Known graphics problems</H3>

<UL>
    <LI>When an obscured part of a window is exposed,
	it may not be repaired (redrawn) until the program
	pauses to await an event
    <LI>Some Java implementations create a window that is one pixel wider
	than requested
    <LI>DEC Java 1.1.6 sometimes writes different fonts to the window
	and its backup image, leading to bizarre effects from
	<CODE>CopyArea()</CODE> and window repair
    <LI>The <CODE>mono</CODE> font is unpredictable for Solaris Java
	displaying on a non-Solaris X server
    <LI><CODE>WOpen("image=file.gif")</CODE> does not load an image
   	if presented with a multi-part (animated) GIF image
    <LI><CODE>drawop=reverse</CODE> draws the wrong color under rare
	conditions that are not understood
</UL>
