rts/README:  working notes for the runtime system



------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Java class names are assigned as follows.

    i.....	infrastructure
    f$.....	runtime functions
    k$.....	keywords
    l$.....	linked files
    o.....	runtime operators
    p$.....	(user) procedures
    v.....	values and variables

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grep for '#%#%' in the code to find places that need revisiting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some areas where the implementation is known to be not-quite-right
(as distinguished from simply being unimplemented) are as follows.

general:
-- random selection uses Java's RNG, presumably generating different sequences
-- write() is simplified, e.g. doesn't accept file arguments

strings:
-- image(s) doesn't escape special characters
-- trapped substring derefs assume original string hasn't changed underneath

numerics:
-- overflow or underflow is not detected
-- conversion of reals (& possibly integers) to strings does not match v9
-- conversion of strings to reals and integers probably follows different rules
-- "%" just uses the Java "%" operator; does that match what Icon needs?

error reporting:
-- no traceback
-- no recovery
-- long strings are not elided
-- variables are dereferenced for reporting
