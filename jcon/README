rts/README:  working notes for the runtime system

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Java names are assigned as follows.

    i.....	infrastructure classes
    f$.....	runtime function classes
    k$.....	keyword classes
    l$.....	linked file classes
    o.....	runtime operator classes
    p$.....	user procedure classes
    v$.....	user variables
    v.....	implementation value and variable classes

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Grep for '#%#%' in the code to find places that need revisiting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some areas where the implementation is known to be not-quite-right
(as distinguished from simply being unimplemented) are as follows.

general:
-- random selection uses Java's RNG, presumably generating different sequences
-- write() is simplified, e.g. doesn't accept file arguments
-- structures don't have serial numbers yet

strings:
-- image(s) doesn't escape special characters
-- trapped substring derefs assume original string hasn't changed underneath

numerics:
-- overflow or underflow is not detected
-- conversion of reals (& possibly integers) to strings does not match v9
-- conversion of strings to reals and integers probably follows different rules
-- "%" just uses the Java "%" operator; does that match what Icon needs?

error reporting:
-- no error recovery yet
-- long strings are not elided, list contents are omitted, etc.
-- main's argument list is shown in the traceback

arguably correct differences:
-- "n to MAXINT" case works correctly in to-by
-- 1 / 0 gives error 201 instead of error 204
-- traceback is deliberately limited to the innermost 100 nested calls
-- "R . field" errors (e.g. 107, 207) give actual field name attempted
