jcon/test

This directory contains automated test for jcon.
The important scripts are:

    runtest	runs tests -- all or some

    addtest	adds a new test, using icont as baseline for correctness

    jxprof	runs a Jcon program with profiling
		(robustness and reliability of this tool is questionable)

See the script headers for usage.
