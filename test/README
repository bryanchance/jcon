jcon/test -- Jcon test directory

This directory contains automated test for jcon.
The important scripts are:

    runtest	runs tests -- all or some

    addtest	adds a new test, using icont as baseline for correctness

See the script headers for usage.

Some tests produce different output when run by Version 9 of Icon.
